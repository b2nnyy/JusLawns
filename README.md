# JusLawns — Website

Revenue-first website for **JusLawns**, built with React + Vite for GitHub Pages. The site includes a **multi-page funnel** with online booking, smart quote routing, and a calendar-based scheduling system.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 19 + Vite 8 |
| Styling | Plain CSS with CSS variables |
| Fonts | Google Fonts — Playfair Display + DM Sans |
| Routing | `react-router-dom` with `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility |
| Maps | `leaflet` + `react-leaflet` with OpenStreetMap tiles |
| Calendar | `react-calendar` for date selection in booking flow |
| Forms | Formspree-ready forms with mailto fallback |
| Icons | `react-icons` |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages |

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Run inside Cursor / VS Code (Dev Container)

If your machine doesn’t have Node installed—or you want a consistent environment—use the included Dev Container:

1. Install Docker Desktop and the **Dev Containers** extension in Cursor/VS Code.
2. Command Palette → **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** (open the `JusLawns` folder first).
3. After the container builds and `npm install` finishes, in the integrated terminal run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the forwarded URL (port **5173**), e.g. `http://localhost:5173/#/`.

The repo includes [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) (Node 22) if you use **nvm** / **fnm** on the host instead.

## Current Site Structure

The app is no longer a single landing page. It now uses route-based pages:

- `/` — Home
- `/services-pricing` — Redirects to `/book` (services, pricing badges, and booking in one flow)
- `/book` — Interactive multi-select service catalog (tap to select one or more services), then a 3-step booking wizard (Date → Your Info → Confirmation). No payment on the site; data posts to Google Apps Script (Sheet + Calendar).
- `/service-area` — Service area map and neighborhood coverage
- `/contact-quote` — Contact and quote capture
- `/terms` — Terms & Conditions
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy

Because the site deploys to GitHub Pages, routing uses `HashRouter` so deep links work without server rewrites.

## Conversion Strategy

The site was restructured to reduce friction and move buying information closer to the top:

- Home page now leads with **Hero → Pricing → Services → TrustStrip → CTA**
- The old **Gallery** and **Testimonials** sections were removed from the live funnel
- Navigation now uses page buttons instead of long-scroll anchor links
- Pricing and quote actions are surfaced earlier and more often

## Architecture Notes

- `App.jsx` owns the global modal state (supports pre-selected service for smart routing)
- `Navbar` and `Footer` are global and render on every route
- Page-level composition happens inside `src/pages/`
- Content stays centralized in `src/data/siteData.js`
- The service-area page uses a real Leaflet map with approximate neighborhood-center pins

## Booking backend (Google Apps Script)

Bookings are submitted from [`src/pages/BookService.jsx`](src/pages/BookService.jsx) to a deployed **Google Apps Script** web app (`APPS_SCRIPT_URL`). The script is **not** stored in this repository.

After a booking row is appended successfully, add client confirmation email in the script’s `doPost` handler using `GmailApp.sendEmail()` (see the sample in your internal `cursor-prompt.md` or deployment notes). Requirements:

- Run the script as a Google account that can send as **info@juslawns.com** (Gmail “Send mail as” alias or primary inbox).
- First-time runs will prompt for Gmail authorization.

No frontend change is required for email; the payload already includes `email`, `firstName`, `service`, and `date`.

## Service Area Map

The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet. Pin data lives in `src/data/siteData.js` as structured objects with:

```js
{ name, lat, lng }
```

These coordinates are **approximate neighborhood center points**, not customer property addresses.

## Deployment Notes

1. Keep the `base` in `vite.config.js` aligned with the repo name (`/JusLawns/`)
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages

If you later switch to a custom domain and a server that supports SPA rewrites, you can move from `HashRouter` to `BrowserRouter`.
